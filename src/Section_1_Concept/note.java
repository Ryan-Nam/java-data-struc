    *  What is Data Structure?
    *  - Data Structure: A template that enables using Data efficiently.
    *  It can be examed by the Time Complexity and Space Complexity
    *
    *  What is Time Complexity?
    * - Time efficiency of certain Data structure
    * - Less Time complexity is good data structure
    * - Ex) Let's say, if you organize books well in shelf, you will find the book you are looking for easily later.
    *  same as well, in this case, you are reducing time-complexity by using book shelf (Data structure)
    *
    * What is Space Complexity?
